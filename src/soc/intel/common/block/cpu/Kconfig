config SOC_INTEL_COMMON_BLOCK_CAR

	  This option allows you to select how cache-as-ram (CAR) is set up.

config INTEL_CAR_NEM
	bool
	default n
	help
	  Traditionally, CAR is set up by using Non-Evict mode. This method
	  does not allow CAR and cache to co-exist, because cache fills are
	  blocked in NEM.

config INTEL_CAR_CQOS
	bool
	default n
	help
	  Cache Quality of Service allows more fine-grained control of cache
	  usage. As result, it is possible to set up a portion of L2 cache for
	  CAR and use the remainder for actual caching.

config INTEL_CAR_NEM_ENHANCED
	bool
	default n
	help
	  A current limitation of NEM (Non-Evict mode) is that code and data sizes
	  are derived from the requirement to not write out any modified cache line.
	  With NEM, if there is no physical memory behind the cached area,
	  the modified data will be lost and NEM results will be inconsistent.
	  ENHANCED NEM guarantees that modified data is always
	  kept in cache while clean data is replaced.
